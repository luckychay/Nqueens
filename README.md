During running time, the program will print generation number and fitness score. When the fitness score reaches 0, the solution is found. 

If the solution is find or the generation exceeds 10000, the program will stop. The result and time consuming will be output to the screen if solution if found, else telling the generation number exceeds the limitation.   

In the file named result.txt, two solutions for 100 queens and two solutions for 150 queens are listed.
